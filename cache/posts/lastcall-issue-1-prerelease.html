Where there are sober people, there will be drinks.<br/>
Where there are drunk people, they will live to party another day.<br/>
Where there are anti-party people, they will be silenced<br/>
Where there is sorrow, there will be liquor<br/>
Where there are hangovers, there will be burritos and Gatorade<br/>
Where there is unemployment, there will be cheap drinks<br/>
And there there is sunlight, there will be a dark, air conditioned bar.<br/>
By the power of the GROGNOX I swear this oath:<br/>
Ergo Bibamus to one and all!<br/>
I am the hero known as [LASTCALL](http://lastcall.vegas)!<br/>
